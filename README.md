# Cryptocurrencies

## The cryptocurrency investigation project where I had to tranform information to tailor what I wanted to be able to visualize my results was a success. I used several visualization methods in the forms of first "preprocessing" the data inside the csv file crypto_data.csv by removing certain columns, storing the new data in other DataFrames to be used later, creating dummy variables to be used in my visualizations, then standardizing the data using StandardScaler. THe first actual visualization I created was using the PCA algorithm in order to split the data into three components named "PC 1", "PC 2", "PC 3". Next I used KMEANS in order to cluster the components into classes and also created a data table displaying the data. Lastly, I used PlotlyExpress to plot the clusters in order to visualize the results in a 3d plot and a 2d plot (all using the hvplot function). The output of this project showed different datatypes which would help clients get an idea of what the cryptocurrency market currently looks like and the types of coins they might be interested in in easily understandable visualizations (each different coin class is separated into clusters and then colored accordingly).
